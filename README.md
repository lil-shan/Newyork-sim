### Project Description
This project is a web application that shows users which people they follow on a social media platform who do not follow them back. It provides an easy way to track non-mutual follows with a simple and interactive interface.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Many social media users wonder if those they follow are actually following back. This project solves the "non-problem" of tracking unreciprocated follows, saving users from endless manual checks and social media drama.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is a playful website that connects to your social media API, fetches your followers and following lists, compares them, and displays the list of users who don‚Äôt follow you back. It‚Äôs a trivial tool that satisfies curiosity but serves no true purpose other than entertainment.
